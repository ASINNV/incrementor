Success!

## _THOUGHTS_

This project went really well. I started it early yesterday but soon after stopped because Dennis arrived, an old friend my brother and I grew up with. So a day's rest later, here am I having finished the project in under an hour. Granted, it was a much shorter, much easier project than usual, it was formidable because it dealt with JavaScript. I had to create a counter for the first time (well, months ago I had made one but I forgot I swear!). Anyway, it was a great experience, because it worked! So sweet are the spoils of war when war doesn't even happen. There was little to no frustration with this project. I got stuck once or twice, and went online for the answer, but I didn't receive much help and my counter method was altogether different than those I found online. I did get confirmation for an idea I had from a website but that only saved a bit of time.

Just implemented two new functions, one to stop the counter from going under zero and the other to show a little snippet of text at the bottom of the screen on every multiple of nine. They both went off without a hitch. Beautiful!

My method may not have been the most efficient or exactly what was asked for but I made it work and with that, I bid you adieu.
